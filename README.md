Convex Hull in Image processing and collision avoidance.
The convex hull (CH) of a set of points is defined as the smallest convex polygon that encloses all the points in the set.
Computing the convex hull is a problem in computational geometry. 
The property of the polygon that wraps around the given points is referred to as the  convexity. 
Even though it is a useful tool in its own right, it is also helpful in constructing other structures like Voronoi diagrams, 
and in applications like unsupervised image analysis. On the other hand, the demand for image processing increases dramatically these days. 

The predominant task in an image processing work is shape based feature extraction. 
In order to recognize and further process delineable shape, a robust shape holder or shape capturing method is needed. 
This is where convex hulls come to play an important role.
In image processing, convex hull image is the set of pixels found in the smallest of convex polygons with all white pixels present in the input of a binary image.
We propose to answer the question of how a convex hull is applied in the realm of image processing and pattern recognition. 
The report will study the four approaches for generation of convex hulls in image processing with focus mainly on two of them. 
Moreover, the report will discuss the advantages of these algorithms and their limitations.
Considering the wide applications that have happened in recent years. The report will also present the future scope for convex hull application in image processing.
